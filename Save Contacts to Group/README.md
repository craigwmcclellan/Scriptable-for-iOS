# Save Contacts to Group

This (unfinished) script is allows users to create new contact groups on iOS from contacts. If you enter a particular note string (I recommend Emoji) into the note field of a contact, this script will ask for the string and the name of a contact group. If the group exists, it will just add all contacts with that note field to the contact group. If the group doesn't exist, it will create the group, then add the contacts.

I'm posting here now to share and identify bugs.
